# Warzone
The game was built using Eclipse's new CDT built system to build and deploy C++ applications without CMake file. However, it is still possible to pull the repo's source code and have the CMake file to build the app locally on VSCode IDE.

The game's concept revolves around Risk -- a strategy game that focuses on diplomacy, conquests, discord and conflict!.
